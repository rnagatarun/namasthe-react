# React Component Lifecycle Example

This example demonstrates the **React Class Component Lifecycle** using a parent component (`About`) and two child components (`ChildFirst` and `ChildSecond`). The logs show the order of execution during the **mounting phase**.

## Lifecycle Logs

### Logs Output (With Two Child Components):
```plaintext
Parent constructor --(About.js Class)
Parent render --(About.js Class)
  ChildFirst constructor --(ChildFirst)
  ChildFirst render --(ChildFirst)
  ChildSecond constructor --(ChildSecond)
  ChildSecond render --(ChildSecond)
  ChildFirst componentDidMount --(ChildFirst)
  ChildSecond componentDidMount --(ChildSecond)
Parent componentDidMount --(About.js Class)
```

## Why Are API Calls Made Inside `componentDidMount`?

API calls are typically made inside the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method because:

1. **Avoiding Side Effects During Rendering**:
   - The `render()` method should remain pure and only return JSX. Making API calls inside `render()` can cause side effects, which is against React's best practices.

2. **Ensuring the Component is Mounted**:
   - The `componentDidMount` method is called after the component has been rendered and added to the DOM. This ensures that the component is ready to display data fetched from the API.

3. **Avoiding Multiple API Calls**:
   - If API calls are made in the constructor or `render()`, they might be triggered multiple times due to re-renders. `componentDidMount` is called only once during the mounting phase, making it the ideal place for one-time setup tasks like API calls.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Keeping API calls in `componentDidMount` separates the logic for fetching data from the logic for rendering the UI, making the code easier to maintain and debug.

## Explanation of Lifecycle with Two Child Components

### 1. **Parent Constructor (`About` Component)**
- **Log**: `Parent constructor --(About.js Class)`
- The constructor of the parent component is called first to initialize the parent state.

### 2. **Parent Render (`About` Component)**
- **Log**: `Parent render --(About.js Class)`
- The `render()` method of the parent is called, which includes rendering both child components (`ChildFirst` and `ChildSecond`).

### 3. **ChildFirst Constructor**
- **Log**: `ChildFirst constructor --(ChildFirst)`
- The constructor of the first child component is called to initialize its state.

### 4. **ChildFirst Render**
- **Log**: `ChildFirst render --(ChildFirst)`
- The `render()` method of the first child component is called to return its JSX.

### 5. **ChildSecond Constructor**
- **Log**: `ChildSecond constructor --(ChildSecond)`
- The constructor of the second child component is called to initialize its state.

### 6. **ChildSecond Render**
- **Log**: `ChildSecond render --(ChildSecond)`
- The `render()` method of the second child component is called to return its JSX.

### 7. **ChildFirst `componentDidMount`**
- **Log**: `ChildFirst componentDidMount --(ChildFirst)`
- After rendering, the `componentDidMount()` method of the first child is called to perform side effects like API calls.

### 8. **ChildSecond `componentDidMount`**
- **Log**: `ChildSecond componentDidMount --(ChildSecond)`
- After rendering, the `componentDidMount()` method of the second child is called to perform side effects like API calls.

### 9. **Parent `componentDidMount`**
- **Log**: `Parent componentDidMount --(About.js Class)`
- Finally, the `componentDidMount()` method of the parent is called after all child components have mounted.

This explanation provides a clear understanding of why `componentDidMount` is the preferred place for API calls and how the lifecycle works with multiple child components.
